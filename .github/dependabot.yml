    # Optionally, you can specify any additional package-ecosystem-specific settings.
    # For Python, you may want to pin certain dependencies to a specific version.
    # For example, if you want to pin the requests library to version 2.26.0:
    # python:
    #   - package: "requests"
    #     version: ">=2.26.0,<3.0.0"
